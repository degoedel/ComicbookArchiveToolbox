**Comicbook Archive Toolbox** is a utility for digital comic book archives such as .cbr or .cbz files.
It was first develloped to split files too big to be comfortably used in digital readers,
but rapidly evolved to include several split strategies, a merge tool, and a metadata editor.
It's designed to be easily extensible.
For now only ComicRack (ComicData.xml) metadata files are supported for edition.

Split strategies are :
- by number of resulting files ;
- by max page number in resulting files ;
- by max size of resulting files.

**Comicbook Archive Toolbox** depends on a redistributed executable of [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org) for compression and decompression tasks.
Window styling is made with [Mahapps.metro](https://mahapps.com), 
and general architecture is made with [Prism](https://github.com/PrismLibrary/Prism).
